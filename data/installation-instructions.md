### Requirements

Make sure your device has a dedicated GPU (Nvidia / AMD cards) to be able to run the pack.  
Running the pack with Intel integrated GPU may crash your Minecraft due to the complexity of the 3D Models.  
It is recommended to use either <KEYWORD_START>Optifine<KEYWORD_END> or <KEYWORD_START>Iris<KEYWORD_END> to improve performance.

### Compatibility

Brickcraft is playable in **every version after 1.13**. If you encounter a compatibility issue message in any version after that one, I suggest you to just ignore it. Please report any critical issues on my <OFFICIAL_SERVER>.

### Installation Steps

1. Download the resource pack from the [Download](download.html) page.
2. Open Minecraft and go to the Options menu.
3. Click on Resource Packs and then on Open Resource Pack Folder.
4. Move the downloaded file into the folder that just opened.
5. Go back to Minecraft and activate the pack in the Resource Packs menu.
